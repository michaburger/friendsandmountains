<h1>About this project</h1>
<p class="lead">A community of internationals, meeting in the Swiss mountains and making friends</p>

        <h2>What's it all about?</h2>
        <p>
            This project was initially called "Couchsurfing Camps." However, since we've always welcomed people from 
            outside the Couchsurfing community, we decided to adopt the more inclusive name "Friends and Mountains." 
            We are essentially a group of internationals meeting in the Swiss mountains and making friends. But don't worry,
            we remain connected to the Couchsurfing community - that's why we kept the orange color!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Couchsurfing has a wonderful community of travelers and open-minded people who typically host others in their homes 
            for free and share memorable experiences. Like any community, we enjoy gathering in larger groups. While some meet 
            in bars or organize city couch crashes, we in Switzerland prefer mountain camps!

        <h2>Why mountain camps?</h2>
        <p>
            In Switzerland, hostels are relatively expensive (over €50 per night) and our cities are smaller compared to other 
            countries, making it challenging to organize gatherings and host everyone. At the same time, we're blessed with 
            stunning mountains and nature - so why not combine them in an event?
        </p>
        <p>
            Renting a chalet for a group is more affordable - approximately €20 per person - and we can share food costs, 
            making it accessible to people from all backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ambiance doesn't suffer from everyone being inside the hut - quite the opposite! We've always had amazing vibes -
            cooking together, playing board games, making music, and for New Year's events, even building jacuzzis and hosting 
            costume parties.

        <h2>How did it all start?</h2>
        <p>
            The first 10 editions of the New Year's camp were organized by Giuze, who started the initiative and grew the event 
            from a small gathering in a hut without electricity to the New Year's celebration it is today. After the 10th edition, 
            Mikka decided this type of event was too good to let go and organized the 11th NYE edition in the Bernese mountains 
            and the 1st CS summer camp in Graubünden, with an entirely new group of people.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tradition continues, and we're excited to see what the future brings. Perhaps we'll form an association or organize 
            other exciting events! Feel free to reach out if you have ideas or if you've attended an event and want to get more 
            involved in the organization.

        <h2>Why this website?</h2>
        <p>
            While it might seem unnecessary given the existence of couchsurfing.com, this website provides newcomers with a glimpse 
            of what our events look like. Additionally, for more complex events like ours (involving house reservations and food 
            purchases for everyone), automated registration and payment systems are invaluable, especially as we operate on a volunteer basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our events are completely non-commercial and volunteer-driven, but since we need to rent accommodation and share food, 
            there is a participation fee that we strive to keep as affordable as possible.

        <p>
            <strong>Mikka</strong> is the main organizer and handles all the administrative aspects of each event. 
            Past participants often help during events with tasks like shopping. We typically have a helpful group of volunteers.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're considering establishing a Swiss association to ensure the long-term sustainability of these events.
